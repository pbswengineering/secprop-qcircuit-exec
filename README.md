## Abstract

Quantum computing is a disruptive technology that is expected to offer significant advantages in many critical fields (e.g. drug discovery, cryptography). The security of information processed by such machines is therefore paramount. Currently, modest noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are available. The goal of this work is to identify how to ensure security properties (e.g. secrecy, integrity) while using quantum processors owned by potentially untrustworthy providers.

## Usage

The experiments described in the article can be replicated with the programs `src/single_experiment.py` and `src/multiple_experiments.py`.
